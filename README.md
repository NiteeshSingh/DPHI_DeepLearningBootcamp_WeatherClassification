# DPHI_DeepLearningBootcamp_WeatherClassification

##It Contains 2 colab file

#### DPhi_Datathon.ipynb
 * It contains the Weather Classifer Build From Scratch using tensorflow
 * used data augumentation to counter overfitting
 
#### WeatherTypePrediction.ipynb  

 * Used VGG-19 model with pretrained weights on imagenet datset
 * fine tuned the model 
 * used data augumentation 
 * Used EarlyStopping Learning rate sheduler
 * used caching and preloding to make learning faster
